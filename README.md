# Image-Conversion
C# Project: Image Conversion (Kirsch Edge Detection)
This program converts an input image to an output image where the output image is formed by applying “Kirsch edge detection” to the input image. The files “21_training.tif” and “21_training.csv” contain the input image. The file “21_training_edges.csv” will be created when the program finishes running. The input image “21_training.tif” is a color image of a retina taken from the DRIVE (digital retinal images for vessel extraction) database at the url http://www.isi.uu.nl/Research/Databases/DRIVE/.
